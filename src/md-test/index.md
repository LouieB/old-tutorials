# Markdown Test Tutorial

This is a test markdown tutorial. If all goes *well*, this will be rendered into HTML.

Here is some **bold** text, and some `inline code`. I would also "quoted text."

> This is a block quote.

## Code Sample

```javascript
var x = runMyFunction('foo');
console.log(x);
```
