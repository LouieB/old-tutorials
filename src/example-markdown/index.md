This tutorial is written in **markdown**. This is a *much* easier format to write in than HTML!

## Code Blocks 

All the GitHub extensions should be available. For example, you can include language-specific code blocks that will be highlighted using prism.

```javascript
//comments
var x = 'Hello World!';
console.log(x);
```

## Tables

Tables should also work.

First Name | Last Name
--- | ---
Frodo | Baggins
Bilbo | Baggins
Gandalf | The Grey
